# Student Management System

This project is a simple Student Management System implemented in C programming language. It allows users to add student records, display student details, calculate the average marks of students, and save/load student data to/from a file.

The system is designed to demonstrate basic file handling, data structures (structs), and modular programming using separate source and header files.

## Features
- Add new student records with ID, name, and marks
- Display individual student information
- Calculate average marks of all students
- Save student records to a text file
- Load student records from a text file

## Project Structure
- `src/` contains the C source code files (`student_management.c`)
- `include/` contains the header files (`student_management.h`)
- `docs/` contains the project report and documentation

This project follows the guidelines for the C Programming Major Project and adheres to best practices for modular and maintainable code.
